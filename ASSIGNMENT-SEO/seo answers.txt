It acts as a visual identifier for the site, enhancing brand recognition and user experience.
For instance, the "Google" favicon is a small, colorful "G" that appears in your browser tab when you visit google.com, making it easy to spot among multiple open tabs.
Favicon images are typically small and square, usually 16x16 or 32x32 pixels, and are saved in the .ico or .png format.
